This Repository will be the online storage destination for all of my major university programming assignments 
and software engineering projects. It serves as a temporary programming portfolio.

Software Engineering Projects
These projects are organized into named folders mostly by class. These project folders should contain various 
design documents alongside the actual code implementations. You will be able to see how each class progressed my 
design knowledge and depth.
- Library System Project
- Software Engineering I
- Software Engineering II

Game Programming Projects
These game projects were designed and developed throughout the entire semester for the class, starting with the pitch
and then followed up with milestones before the final submission presentation. Here I learned about several elements 
within multiple game engines that are required to define and refine within a game alongside some fun game mechanics 
and functionalities for us to implement in our own games. The main classes were mostly tutorial taught, which 
basically means that I wasted my college money because we had to teach the material to ourselves, but I was able to 
find several amazing resources to develop, improve, and alter for my games. Alongside the major game programming 
courses, I was able to explore a Game Math and Physics course where we played with rigid bodies and gravity mechanics 
to solve problems and add an extra dimension of creativity into our games.
Unfortunately, the code for my first two game programming experiences were not able to be transfered to my database, 
but I was able to keep a copy of the executables. And as a precaution, none of the visual and audio assets belong to 
me, the are rightfully owned by their various publishers and companies with the exception of one music file, titled 
"adventure" within the Game Programming I exe folder, that was composed by me. The use of these assests were solely 
for educational purposes only.
- Game Programming I (DirectX)
- Game Math and Physics (Box2D)
- Game Programming II (Unreal 4)

The last couple of folders within this repository contain various major programming assignments over the course of my 
computer science degree that I threw in to justify my extensive experience with C and C++ in pursuit of profecciency.
There is also a random MIPS assembly code folder for no significant reason other than show and possibly humor.
