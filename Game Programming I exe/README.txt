CSCE - Game Programming I

This was my first attempt at making a real video game. Using Visual Studios 2013, I worked within a DirectX game engine environment that has been modified by Dr. Parberry. This class focused more on explaining the tutorial code than teaching how the code works in real-time and how we can add on to it, so we had to go and figure out everything about how to use and develop within the engine on our own. I also ended up being the only remaining member in my group to work on this project at the end of the semester so it was an even greater struggle. In retrospect, I feel very proud of how much work and design I was able to program into this game, but I understand that it needs a ton more work to be a polished product. Unfortunately, I was unable to transfer any of the code files that I programmed after the class had ended, but I was able to get a copy of the executable and it's assests.

Within this project, I was able to design and develop many basic elements that go into a 2D side-scrolling game. These included: level design, player skills and abilities, player health and damage, AI functionalities both neutral and hostile, and simple animations dealing with movement, attacking, and taking damage. Most of my visual and audio assests were modified assests found on the internet for lack of creative ability and time, but the soundtrack was written by me thanks to my music background. Some of the stranger assests that were implemented were added in by former group members that I decided to leave in after they left due to other priority objectives and issues dealing with actual code. So I apologize for those uncomforable inconveniences.

This class was not very involved with the whole design and development process, but we were given a pitch date and a milestone date before the final presentation for a basic development process.

The executable file is named "Final Executable" within the folder.
