Rube Goldberg Program

This programming assignment featured the use of Box2D to build an entertaining Rube Goldberg machine within the virtual environment. Using everything that we have learned about Box2D and our knowledge with math and physics, I was able to design a fun and eventful game themed in a classic Star Wars moment. The game is timed from the start and features our heroic droids attempting to save our friends from being squished by the trash compactor! Of course, when playing with time, the game can be a little gimicky, but R@ is usually able to save the day most of the time.

The main focus for this assignment was to experiment with unti collisions in a physics based environment and modifying existing tools and game mechanics to keep the Rube Goldberg machine flowing to the end.

The executable is named "Rube Goldberg" in the folder.
To start the machine just press the space bar after launching the application. I recommend pressing space bar almost immediately to save our friends in time!
